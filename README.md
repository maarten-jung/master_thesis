## Python and R Code of My First Masterâ€™s Thesis 
This repository contains the code used for the simulations and analyses of my first master's thesis **[Reaction Time Modeling in Bayesian Cognitive Models of Sequential Decision-Making Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-740483)**.  
Along with the Python and R scripts, I uploaded all *.json and *.csv files that are generated when these scripts are run. Due to GitHub's file size limit, the *.json files are managed by Git LFS.
