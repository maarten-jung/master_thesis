## Python and R Code Master's Thesis 
This repository contains the code used for the simulations and analyses of my master's thesis **Reaction Time Modeling in Bayesian Cognitive Models of Sequential Decision-Making Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling**.  
Along with the Python and R scripts, I uploaded all *.json and *.csv files that are generated when these scripts are run. Due to GitHub's file size limit, the *.json files are managed by Git LFS.
